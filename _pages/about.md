I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at New York University. My research interests lie in scheduling, online algorithms, and algorithm design. I am very fortunate to be advised by Anupam Gupta.

Before starting my PhD, I received my Honors Bachelor Degree from the ACM Honors Class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

## Acknowledgements

I am grateful to the people who guided and mentored me during my undergraduate studies, including Yuhao Zhang, Zhiyi Huang, Meng He, and Richard Peng.
