I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at New York University. My research interests lie in scheduling, online algorithms, and algorithm design. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Anupam Gupta](https://cs.nyu.edu/~anupamg/).

Before starting my PhD, I received my Honors Bachelor Degree from the ACM Honors Class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
