I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at New York University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Anupam Gupta](https://cs.nyu.edu/~anupamg/). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's Degree from the ACM Honors Class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests lie in theoretical computer science, with a focus on online algorithms, scheduling, and graph algorithms.
